* add image to algorithm explanation
* check if rooted

* implement ways to set naming scheme
* find more meaningful example with phylo mode!!

* add option to viz gene and species tree + gene tree and sptaxonomy but in future






* maybe let the user get the orthologous tree before analysing a tree with duplications and losses.

	* For now only option to collapse_lineage_specific_expansions.
	* Alternatively, get speciation trees and apply to abaccus to all of them that have seed species.


* add run many abccus as available script??
